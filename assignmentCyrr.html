<ol>
	<li>In a fixed exchange rate system, the demand increase would be rectified by central bank and reverse the excess demand for francs either by lowering domestic interest rates, selling francs on the market to increase supply and drive down the exchange rate to its initial level, imposing legal requirements on the exchange rate, or by directly targeting and eliminating the reason for the increased demand. This sort of question cannot be thoroughly answered without knowing the reason for the increasing demand. In this case, the exchange rate and quantity of francs supplied will not change. If interest rates are lowered, the aggregate demand may increase overall, and foreign investment may decrease, lowering the demand further for francs. <br> In a floating exchange rate system, the demand increase will increase the quantity supplied of francs and the exchange rate as well from a to b and from .2 to .25, respectively. This will cause the currency to appreciate which can have negative effects on the balance of payments and the trade position as foreign exports will decrease (they become more expensive) and imports increase (they become cheaper). </li>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<li>The consumption of limited official reserves is unsustainable and will quickly drain a country's coffers, while the production and overprinting of currency will lead to inflation.</li>
			<li>Import/Export policy can be seen as aggresive and lead to political and economic retaliation.</li>
			<li>Interest rate manipulation can lead to inflation if increased and deflation if decreased</li>
			<li>Exchange controls limit foreign direct investment and FOREX traders.</li>
		</ul>

	<li>a) 400 Ringgits / 0.4 dollars <br> b) There would be 600 ringgits supplied and 200 ringgits demanded, which would be a surplus of ringgits. This artificial overpricing of ringgits will reduce exports and increase imports, having a negative affect on AD and a country's balance of payments. Domestic industries will also suffer as a result of the increased imports</li>
	<li>
		<br>a) 45-51 = -6 bn
		<br>b) -6 + 15 - 6 = 3bn
		<br>c) -6 + 3 - 10 + 12 = 5bn
		<br>d) 25-33 = -8bn
		<br>e) sum of a â†’ d is -5, so +ve 5bn will be required to settle the BoP accounts. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<br>3) Balance of trade = 390-498 = -108 bn
		<br>6) Balance on services = 133 - 107 = 26 bn
		<br>7) Balance on g/s = 26-108 = -82 bn
		<br>10) Balance on Current Account = -82 - 22 + 12 = -92 bn
		<br>13) Balance on Capital Account = 117-59 = 58 bn  
		<br>14) Current and Capital Balance = 58-92 = -34 bn
		<br>15) Official reserves = -(C&C balance) = 34 bn
		<br>Sums to 0; Currently running a deficit, as usual.
