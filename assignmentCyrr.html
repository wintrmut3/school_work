<ol>
	<li>In a fixed exchange rate system, the demand increase would be rectified by central bank and reverse the excess demand for francs either by lowering domestic interest rates, or directly targeting and eliminating the reason for the increased demand. This sort of question cannot be thoroughly answered without knowing the reason for the increasing demand. In this case, the exchange rate and quantity of francs supplied will not change. <br> In a floating exchange rate system, the demand increase will increase the quantity supplied of francs and the exchange rate as well from a to b and from .2 to .5, respectively.</li>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<li>The consumption of limited official reserves is unsustainable and will quickly drain a country's coffers, while the production and overprinting of currency will lead to inflation.</li>
			<li>Import/Export policy can be seen as aggresive and lead to political and economic retaliation.</li>
			<li>Interest rate manipulation can lead to inflation if increased and deflation if decreased</li>
			<li>Exchange controls limit foreign direct investment and FOREX traders.</li>
		</ul>

	<li>a) 400 Ringgits / 0.4 dollars <br> b) There would be 500 ringgits supplied and 300 ringgits demanded, which would be a surplus of ringgits. This artificial overpricing of ringgits will reduce exports and increase imports, having a negative affect on AD and a country's balance of payments. Domestic industries will also suffer as a result of the increased imports</li>
	<li>
		<br>a) 45-51 = -6 bn
		<br>b) -6 + 15 - 6 = 3bn
		<br>c) 3 - 10 + 12 = 5bn
		<br>d) 25-33 = -8bn
		<br>e) sum of a â†’ d is -5, so +ve 5bn will be required to settle the BoP accounts. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<br>3) Balance of trade = 390-498 = -108 bn
		<br>6) Balance on services = 133 - 107 = 26 bn
		<br>7) Balance on g/s = 26-108 = -82 bn
		<br>10) Balance on Current Account = -82 - 22 + 12 = -92 bn
		<br>13) Balance on Capital Account = 117-59 = 58 bn  
		<br>14) Current and Capital Balance = 58-92 = -34 bn
		<br>15) Official reserves = -(C&C balance) = 34 bn
		<br>Sums to 0; Currently running a deficit, as usual.
