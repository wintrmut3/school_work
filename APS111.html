<li>An engineering notebook is required for this class, first with the information of my group members. It must be bound.</li>
<li>The <em>Engineering Design Process</em> is a rigorous and standardized method by which a solution to a problem may be designed, with particular emphasis on the definition of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining a problem involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information management</li>
<li>Client statement analysis</li>
<li>Quite a bit of research</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution generation<br>
Solution Evaluation<br>
Solution Implementation</p>
<p>There are different time distributions between the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Design Brief</li>
<li>Problem statement</li>
<li><strong>Requirements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Solution Generation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Evaluation and Testing</strong></li>

<h3 id="design-process-overview">Design Process Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>The design process is iterative</li>
<li>This stops before the ideal solution is met, but usually is not bad</li>
<li>The formal engineering design process (EDP) relies on tools and methods to craft: <em>requirements</em> and complete <em>documentation</em></li>
<li>Creativity methods are used, to generate imaginative solutions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-phases">Project Phases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design problems are <em>open ended problems</em></li>
<li>A team must develop a <em>problem statement</em> which defines and guides the process</li>
<li>Once a problem is defined, ideas are generated, known as <em>conceptual design (alternatives)</em>.</li>
<li>Evaluating these ideas requires decision making tools, comparing against the criteria and requirements to make sure they match</li>
<li>Reality checks are important, to check feasibility</li>
<li>Steps are:
<ol start="0">
<li>Design Brief</li>
<li>Requirements</li>
<li>Problem Statement</li>
<li>Solution Generation</li>
<li>Evaluation and testing</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="navigating-the-engineering-design-process">Navigating the Engineering Design Process</h3>
<ul>
<li>The design process is about defining and reshaping the <em>design space</em> - the set of possible solutions considered during a project.</li>
<li>Requirement generation defines the design space</li>
<li>New solution generation expands/populates this space, while discarding ideas shrinks it. Testing explores it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="requirements-generation">Requirements Generation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Begin with a clear idea of what is being solved</li>
<li>This is defined by a problem statement and requirements (describing the functions that a solution must have to be valid).</li>
<li>The requirements also include objectives, constraints and context in which the solution will operate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="multi-use-design-tools">Multi Use Design tools</h4>
<ul>
<li>These are techniques used in the design process to generate requirements, ideas, and solutions.</li>
<li>Idea generation tools can be used to make requirements or solution ideas</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="decision-making">Decision Making</h4>
<ul>
<li>These tools reduce the design space, and are crucial to show what parts to pursue and discard</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="iteration">Iteration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generate - Select - Reflect cycles allow you to move towards an optimal solution (not an ideal solution).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="investigating">Investigating</h4>
<ul>
<li>Developing models and prototyping to test early design solutions to give an understanding of the problem and the solutions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="post-conceptual-design">Post Conceptual Design</h4>
<ul>
<li>This covers some common activities needed to implement a design</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-problem-statement">The Problem Statement</h3>
<ul>
<li>A client statement/design brief is used, and from it are extracted the project’s goals.</li>
<li>Sometimes, a solution-driven statement is provided with an implied solution, so an engineer must create a <em>solution independent statement</em> that only contains essential information and addresses the underlying need</li>
<li>Design Briefs may be problematic:
<ul>
<li>Implied solutions</li>
<li>Assumptions</li>
<li>Conflicting information</li>
<li>Typos</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-requirements">The Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>The EDP is essentially an information process</li>
<li>Requirements can be broken down into <em>functions</em> <em>objectives</em> and <em>constraints</em></li>
<li>They require context, research, thinking and the client statement to produce</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="teamwork">Teamwork</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A team and a group are different because a team has a common purpose and uses the skills of all the members to solve a problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross functional teams are interdisciplinary, their opposite is within functional teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teams need not have specific expertise, only to work together as a single entity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pseudoteams</em> work and create output less than the sum of its parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Potential teams</em> work at or slightly better than the sum of their parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Real teams</em> communicate effectively, going well beyond the capability of its individual parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 5 common factors that make teams successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Common goal</li>
<li>Individual and group accountability</li>
<li>Real work to be done, that is valuable and relevant</li>
<li>Conflict and difficulty management strategies</li>
<li>Group processing occurs<br>
[ People Issues, tasks, purpose ]</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Reflections and lessons learned activites are crucial</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-tuckman-team-model">The Tuckman Team Model:</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a model of how teams form and work together<br>
Organizing / Producing split</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Forming / Storming / Norming</li>
<li>Performing / Adjourning</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="team-management">Team Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Team Leader ~	project manager</li>
<li>Oversees assignment of tasks, keep track of where the team is, deal with people issues, communicate with instructor</li>
<li>DO NOT MICROMANAGE</li>
<li>Create an Agenda and Meeting Minutes!</li>
<li>Regular team meetings shouldn’t be more than an hour or two</li>
<li>Minutes from last meeting (deadlines, tasks, decisions) become agenda for current meeting</li>
<li>Task timing is difficult, requiring &gt;=1.5x of original time estimate</li>
<li>PERT/GANTT charts are used to record tasks and timings (but we need to know the tasks)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="people-issues">People Issues:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Hitchhikers - Slackers</li>
<li>Hijackers - “If you want something done right, do it yourself”, overly controlling and untrusting (don’t make them team leader)</li>
<li>Isolationists - Not wanting to interact, non-communicating</li>
<li>Enablers - Help everyone else, but get overwhelmed and cannot ultimately deliver</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="critical-thinking-in-design-documents">Critical Thinking in Design Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complicated means having many interdependent parts</li>
<li>Complex means non deterministic</li>
<li>Project requirements are about looking at a project from multiple perspectives</li>
<li>CDS is about generating solutions and justify a design decision</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the needs and wants described completely?</li>
<li>What is the gap?</li>
<li>What other stakeholder interests/perspectives exist?</li>
<li>What is the context the solution will operate in?</li>
<li>What are the related rules and regulations</li>
<li>What needs to exist to give the client what they want?</li>
<li>How can I maximize positive social and environmental impact?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Many solutions may be generated, and we must examine the unique trade offs and unique information/value provided</li>
<li>Costs/Environment/Social Impacts</li>
<li>Look at lessons learned documents, to see how well we did and what we could do better</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-and-supporting-statements">Making and Supporting Statements</h3>
<p>The 3 categories of statement are</p>
<ol>
<li>Opinion (evaluation made by experts or by feeling/judgement, requiring support)</li>
<li>Facts - Statements of truth, supported by laws of nature or credible info sources (history)</li>
<li>Claims are based on scientific evidence. Engineers use facts to support their claims/complete statements</li>
</ol>
<p>Make a complete claim by stating your idea, explaining it and supporting it with evidence [ STATEMENT / EXPLANATION / EVIDENCE ]</p>
<p>Evidence - is scientific method/principle, research and your own data<br>
Use value free language (not value laden) when making a statement</p>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-good-requirements">Characteristics of Good Requirements</h3>
<p>The team must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agree on the problem being solved, including requirements</li>
<li>Agree on the scope</li>
<li>Prelim eval. on the scope of the project to determine solution set</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scope</strong> defines the breadth and depth of the problem, known also as limits or boundaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scope creep can occur when projects just increase in scope indefinitely and stagnate</li>
<li>DFX considerations means DESIGN FOR X (X is a design consideration, like human factors, safety, a e s t h e t i c, manufacturability etc, …)</li>
<li>Add DFX to a list of Objectives (eg. design for safety for highways), and go back to them while constructing requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="characteristics-of-good-requirements-1">Characteristics of Good Requirements</h4>
<ol>
<li>Completeness (Diminishing returns from going too far, 80/20 rule)</li>
<li>Solution Independence - Only make forced decisions</li>
<li>Testability/ Is there a metric?</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="evaluating-the-problem">Evaluating the Problem</h4>
<p>Before trying to solve the problem, ask:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there an algorithmic/accepted way of solving the problem? <strong>(Routine Design)</strong></li>
<li>Is there an off the shelf solution</li>
<li>Is the project feasible?</li>
<li>What parts of the problem are open/closed (Subproblem analysis)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sizing - Doing a calculation to determine req. capacity of machines/equipment</p>

<ul>
<li>A stakeholder has interests/welfare invested in the tech being created.</li>
<li>They include the client, users and design team (its redundant to mention them)</li>

<h3 id="constraints--not-in-textbook-or-readings">Constraints ** NOT IN TEXTBOOK OR READINGS</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’re defining the boundary conditions of the design space
<ul>
<li>Objectives let us evaluate potential solutions</li>
<li>Constraints tell us what are outside the design space</li>
<li>You should try to minimize the constraints to allow as open a design space as you can while maintaining standards of safety and legality and such.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Objective Goal - If a design fails to meet an objective goal, it is less desirable<br>
Constraint limit - If a design fails to meet the CL, it is rejected/deleted</p>
<p>Constraint Sources - Client, Regulations/Codes/Standards, Stakeholders - Indicated by <em>must</em> or <em>shall</em></p>
<p>Regulations, Codes and Standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulations are laws like OSHA</li>
<li>Codes are interpretations of regulations in engineering-speech, a step by step list (eg. Fire codes)</li>
<li>Standards are not legally required but are what we choose to adhere to - like MILSTD or IEEE standard, or adhering to PIPA. They are <em>mutually agreed upon</em> eg. Connectors = USB</li>
<li>Designing to a standard acts as a shorthand, and international translation</li>
<li>TechStreet gives a source for standards</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Pitfalls with Restraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unmeasurables</li>
<li>Making up metrics or limits that come from nowhere</li>
<li>Confusing Obj and Constraints (These can match)</li>
<li>A project can be about a constraint and not a function, but dont mix them up</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functions">Functions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>What the design must do - Active statements, necessary for design solution</li>
<li>Primary functions are large and can be broken down into subfunctions, requiring careful analysis</li>
<li>Subfunctions enable the primary function</li>
<li>Functional basis is a technique that allows you to describe functions in very basic design terms. it defines a design from a few basic operations on a few flows</li>
<li>The black box method looks at energy/info/matter I/O and looks at conservational data, to figure out what the black-box design actually does</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="functional-basis">Functional Basis:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Operations on flows [Mass/Energy/Information]</li>
<li>Operations are:
<ol>
<li>Sense</li>
<li>Support (Prevent change)</li>
<li>Combine</li>
<li>Separate</li>
<li>Replicate (Info only)</li>
<li>Store</li>
<li>Extract</li>
<li>Transform</li>
<li>Generate (Info only)</li>
<li>Move through space/time</li>
<li>Control - do all of those things above</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="black-box-technique">Black Box Technique</h4>
<ul>
<li>Describes Mass, Energy and Information without describing the design itself</li>
<li>Shows only inputs and outputs, asks you to connect them</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="decomposition">Decomposition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Breaking up a problem into parts, while generating requirements
<ul>
<li>Structural decomposition involves breaking into discrete units</li>
<li>Functional decomposition involves breaking functions into subfunctions and describing the parts needed to fulfil those functions at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="means-analysis">Means Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Decompose the problem into subfunctions, and generate as many ideas to fulfil one function, and look for commonalities - Functions including all the generated solutions probably are important functions (if every solution fits into the function “sticks air to dirt” then it’s probably an important function)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h3>
<ul>
<li>A survey of existing designs, to analyze that which already remains in the market</li>
<li>Performance analysis involves identification of the subfunctions of the item and metrics usable to measure the performance (eg. volume of coffee over time = flow rate) (how long to roll up cord)</li>
<li>Task analysis involves looking at a view independent of the operator, looking at how many steps and what steps are needed to perform an operation, and how much detail is required (self observation) - used for idea gen, obj/reqs</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="formflowfunction-analysis">Form/Flow/Function Analysis</h4>
<p>Involves looking at the functions and how they’re enabled by the form of the design and the flows of mass/energy/info<br>
Form includes size/shape/structure, material properties etc<br>
Type and quantity of flows that are related to the subsystem</p>
<h4 id="why-benchmark">Why Benchmark?</h4>
<p>To uncover new requirements, inspiration, preventing duplication<br>
But it can anchor solutions and pollutes the design space</p>
<h3 id="engineering-communication">Engineering Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draws on science &amp; math to support clear, concise and objective information expression</li>
<li>To develop a professional voice:
<ol>
<li>Look at rules and style guides</li>
<li>Keep a planner</li>
<li>Check grammar</li>
<li>Use objective scientific perspective<br>
Conventions:</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use no contractions</li>
<li>Represent numbers verbally or numerically but not both unless consecutive</li>
<li>When a number starts a sentence it is written out</li>
<li>Use explicit meaning only, don’t imply</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="organizing-communication">Organizing Communication</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use no more than 3 sub section levels</li>
<li>Use numbered headings that are titled, you can start with this cascading structure</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="diagrammatic-elements--visual-representation">Diagrammatic Elements / Visual representation</h4>
<p>-Used to:<br>
- Communicate a model, characteristics, states<br>
- Visual vocabulary may be used, like resistors being squigglies<br>
- Communicate relationships<br>
- Direction and motion<br>
- Labels are used<br>
- Used for Problem Solving</p>
<ul>
<li>Should be clear, well labeled, and relevant to the verbal elements</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="pictures-and-photographs">Pictures and Photographs</h5>
<ul>
<li>Can enhance visual appeal and cause emotion</li>
<li>Is not very precise, but can be used generally</li>
<li>Can be used to instruct and cross language barriers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="analogy---related-to-benchmarking">Analogy - Related to Benchmarking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Biomimetics/Biological Analogy
<ul>
<li>Look at how nature solves a problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technical - Cross disciplinary
<ul>
<li>Not helpful in the orblem phase, look at solutions to similar problems in different fields</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="decomposition-1">Decomposition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Breaking down a problem into parts, eg. umbrella:
<ul>
<li>Barrier, positioning and info about deployment</li>
<li>Then come up with solutions for each element</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Morphchart - Come up with a table of all these elements and mix&amp;match solutions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describes what the design solution <em>should be</em></li>
<li>Measures of effectiveness, to evaluate solutions</li>
<li>Use an objective tree, with a list of objectives from client statement and DFX considerations, then decomposed to specific, measurable objectives</li>
<li>Eg. How Why Trees</li>
<li>Some objectives are mutually exculsive</li>
<li>Pairwise Comparison may be useful, comparing only one item at a time at the same point to create a prioritization and sort</li>
<li>Break down abstract objectives into measureable subobjectives</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pairwise-comparison">Pairwise Comparison</h4>
<ul>
<li>A way to prioritize a list, to eliminate ideas or items from csonideration</li>
<li>Only creates relative priorities and as an approximation</li>
<li>Tabulate in a matrix and decide which is more important (1/0), then order by total points</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-metrics">Using metrics</h3>
<p>A metric is a method to measure a property of some tech<br>
Comparison requires some parameter of a metric to differentiate solutions<br>
When comparing, use approximates and check confidence levels - if it’s 1.1 and 1.0, and the error is <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>±</mo><mn>0.1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pm 0.1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.72777em; vertical-align: -0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord">±</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mord">.</span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span></span> then they;re about equivalent. A 10% difference is probably the same as equivalency.<br>
You can test by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designing binary choices eg. must be a colour</li>
<li>Estimation</li>
<li>Analytical model</li>
<li>Prototyping</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>What a tech <em>must be</em></li>
<li>Absolute limits, which delete violators</li>
<li>Safety and reliability causes them</li>
<li>They come from client consultation, regulations/codes/standards and stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creativity-methods">Creativity Methods</h2>
<h3 id="idea-generation">Idea Generation</h3>
<p>This is a divergent process to expand the design space<br>
Use creativity methods to expose many solutions and evaluate from there, don’t just go with the first thing.</p>
<h4 id="brainstorming">Brainstorming</h4>
<ul>
<li>Generates high quantity, criticismless, can be combined, gets all ideas out</li>
<li>Free Brainstorming is for idea generation, one recorder takes down all ideas for 15-20 minutes, eliminate duplicates and number ideas through multi voting
<ul>
<li>This may be chaotic, can cause conflict, and disadvantage the quiet</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structured brainstorming takes individual brainstorming and takes the best ideas, from each individual
<ul>
<li>It’s good for new teams, and but makes it difficult to build on others’ ideas. Requires multiple rounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to creativity is MISTAKES!</p>
<p>Lateral Thinking is about coming up with other directions to think</p>
<ul>
<li>Why/Why/Why (5)</li>
<li>Assumption Challenging</li>
<li>Reversal method</li>
<li>Random stimulus</li>
<li>Arbitrary Constraint</li>
<li>Blue sky thinking (no constraints)</li>
</ul>
<p>SCAMPER allows you to branch off an idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force fitting, forcing the mind to make creative jumps</li>
<li>Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify+/-, Put to other Uses, Eliminate, Rearrange/Reverse</li>
</ul>
<p>Magic Solutions require nonsensical creations, utilizing “Magic” as a stepping stone to bridge the gap to a solution which may or may not be possible</p>
<p>Morph charts graphically represent the process of putting ideas together</p>
<ul>
<li>Row headers are subfunctions, cells are means. These are combined creatively to enable the primary function</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical analogy draws from solutions to similar problems in other fields.<br>
Biomimetic Analogy draws from nature.</p>
