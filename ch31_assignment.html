    1a. Import substitution is the process by which a country tries to replace foreign imports with domestic production, usually to reduce reliance on foreign trade.
    <br>
    <br>
    b. Real GDP is the gross domestic product, or total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy over a given period (usually a year) adjusted for inflation (sustained rising price levels) relative to some arbitrary base year.

    2. The figure labeled "Tariff Contraction" illustrates the effects of implementing a tariff in India as a protectionist policy against foreign competitors. A tariff is an example of a protectionist policy, it is a direct tax levied against importers by the government.

<br><br>
    Prior to the implementation of the tariff, assuming free trade with the rest of the world, the total quantity of imports demanded in india is given by Q4. This is the intersection of the international supply S(w) and the domestic demand in india D(india). The price for these imports is given at P(w), and the supply of imports is a perfectly elastic line as it is assumed to be of a sufficiently large and stable quantity that it cannot be changed. The implementation of the tariff will increase the cost to global producers, shifting the world supply up to S(w + t). The new intersection of global supply and domestic demand is found at Q3. The effect of this on import quantities is clear. The import quantity is always given by the total quantity minus the quantity of the product produced domestically. Initially, this value is given as Q4 - Q1, but as the price increases for international producers after the implementation of a tariff, this quantity shrinks as domestic producers recieve more and increase production to Q2, while foreign producers lose out as their costs of production increase, and the imports are reduced to the quantity Q3-Q2.

    3. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is investment by an organization or multinational corporation (MNC) in a foreign nation, usually to acquire control over a foreign corporation or sector. Appreciation is a relative increase in exchange rate of one currency against another, in this case, the article states that the Indian rupee (INR) appreciated by 10%, so, in terms of another currency, purchasing the INR has become 10% more expensive.
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    The exchange rate diagram labelled figure 2 shows the effects of increased FDI on the exchange rate of the Indian rupee against the american dollar. Note that the demand for the Indian rupee has increased, from D(INR) to D(INR)*, shifting forward while the supply of the Indian rupee is assumed to have remaind constant at S(INR).The article states that the price increases by 10 percent, and this results from the increased demand, which is illustrated by the shift from P1 to P2.

    The reason that the demand for the Indian Rupee has shifted forward is because foreign direct investment can only be done in the currency of the foreign nation in which the investment takes place. In order for an american country to invest in Indian corporations, they must trade their american dollars to indian rupees to do business with them. This effectively raises the demand for indian rupees, as the increased foreign direct investment results in more foreigners exchanging (ie. demanding) their local currency for the Indian rupee, resulting in the 10 percent apprecation of the INR.

  4.
  Interest rates are the costs of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the original loan. The current account balance is the a register that records the sum of the balance of trade (goods and services exports minus imports), and net income from abroad, as well as a few other minor factors.
<br>
  The impact of increased FDI on the Indian economy is multilateral, resulting in both positive and negative effects.
<br>
  On the positive end, it appears that the GDP growth rate has increased by a bit less than 10% of what it was in 2005 in 2006 from 8.5% to 9.2%. This is a positive for India, as it suggests an improvement in their economy. Economic growth has occurred, and is occurring at an ever increasing rate. The nation's total output of growth and services has increased due to the FDI. As the article states, the FDI increases have created a larger domestic market resulting in more jobs, which results in more production and revenue for corporations, and higher incomes and quality of life for those who have been employed. It is however important to consider whether this rate of growth is sustainable. A real GDP growth rate of nearly 10% per annum is quite high, and some could argue that it is dangerously unsustainable. The source of this growth may be an expansion of industry, but that comes with negative effects, including externalities (costs to third parties not involved in the transaction) and a devolution of labour standards/a promotion of low wage labour. The growth of any economy tends to come with costs to the environment, as greater production exacts a heavier toll on the natural resources it depends on. There is a potential for these resources to become depleted or polluted, such that it harms the citizens or economy of the nation in the long run.
<br><br>
  On the negative side, inflation has increased. Inflation is an increase in the average price level of goods and services over a period of time, and its existence in excess can have several negative effects on the economy. This is incidentally likely a product of the high growth rate as illustrated in figure 3.
  <br><br>
  <a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yf895wp/india-inflation.png" alt="india-inflation" border="0"></a>
  <br><br>
  As the aggregate demand increases from AD to AD* due to the increased FDI (Aggregate demand is a function, specifically a summation, of several factors including investment. Increasing FDI increases AD, shifting it outward) both the real GDP increase from Q1 to Q2, and price levels increase from P1 to P2. The increase in price levels is the inflation that has occurred.
<br><br>

High inflation is bad because it promotes consumption - people are disincentivized to save their money as it becomes progressively less valuable the longer they hold on to it, and therefore spend - in a way that can lead to spirals and also reduces the amount of loanable funds (savings) in an economy, resulting in less stability and less available funds for loaning out. The higher consumption increases AD, which further increases inflation, which increases consumption, and so on. This may force the government to implement contractionary policies, resulting a decreased growth rate and lower employment in the future. The increased interest rate may be an attempt to reduce the inflation rises, and also partially a result of them. Increasing interest rates make it more attractive to save money in a bank, as the return on one's investment increases. This would disincentivize spending in favour of saving, and potentially slow down the inflation. It is partially a result of inflation as well, as the reduced quantity of investment from people saving less forces banks to make it harder to borrow money, as they have less of it, and thus they will raise the costs of borrowing money and make it more lucrative to save money with them by increasing the interest rates.
<br><br>
The final measure mentioned in the article is that of a negative change in the current account balance, illustrating how the inflows of money into India are exceeded by the outflow, and how that quantity of excess has nearly doubled over the 2005-2006 period. This is interesting, and a possible result of the FDI increase. As more FDIs come into India, they certainly produce more, but there is the question of where the revenue from that production is going. As the corporations that introduce the FDIs are not, by defintion, Indian, they will be sending some or most of that money overseas, out of the Indian economy and into foreign ones. This is dangerous for India, as it shows that, while their country's production is increasing, much of the wealth generated from that increased production is in fact going outside of India. If this is suddenly reduced or cut off, there could be catastrophic effects, as India will be unable to rely on FDI support and may suffer a large amount of excess capacity and significant unemployment increases. Moreover, this increased reliance on foreign support means that domestic producers and domestic industry is snuffled out in favour of foreign industry. This can devastate local producers, who cannot compete with their foreign counterparts, and force them to shut down.
<br><br>
In the final evaluation, it is evident that while some benefits emerge from the increased FDI like economic growth, they come at a cost that is significantly higher and more damaging in the long run, as is already being noticed. Negative environmental externalities will become realized, as industry increases, resulting in poorer health and the depletion of natural resources. Inflation is driven higher and, while the rupee appreciates (making domestic exports less competitive and more expensive), it simultaneously loses value inside of India resulting in consumption spirals and lower savings. Interest rates are increased, which is generally neutral in its use to counteract the inflation, but it should be noted that their effects may not be seen for several quarters or longer, and that overcompensation or undercompensation may result in an exacerbation of the initial problem, swinging India's economy into deflation or further inflation. The state of the current account illustrates that India's economy, while become stronger, is losing much of its output and economic benefits to outsiders, while building its dependence on foreign support at the expense of local producers. India may well become a significantly more powerful economic entity on the global stage as a result of open borders and increased FDI, but the economic benefits are going to foreign masters. While India's economy booms, it does so in service of foreign powers, with little benefit ultimately going into its own economic development.
