		<h3>1</h3> <br>
The balance of trade specifically refers the difference between revenue recieved from the exports and the costs of the imports of physical(tangible) goods over a period of time. <br>
The terms of trade are a more specific metric, being the ratio of a weighted sum of average exports prices and average import prices, where the weightings are assigned based on relative importance. The value is multiplied by 100, as it is an index and that is the convention. <br>

<b><br> Differences: </b>
<ul>
	<li>The BoT only accounts for a total amount of export and import revenue and thus is not really appropriate to compare countries with, whereas the ToT is relative and a percentage and so is approriate for international comparison</li>
	<li>The BoT only accounts for physical goods wherease the ToT accounts for both goods and services.</li>
	<li>The ToT is weighted for importance whereas the BoT is a simple summation of raw values, so the ToT is a more precise metric.</li>
</ul>

		The consequences of inflation, which is defined as a sustained increase in price levels over a period of time, on the terms of trade are shown below.

				<td>Relative inflation in a country will drive up all prices, including those for exports. This results in increasd export prices. This will increase the ToT value (numerator increase increases value of a fraction) and thus the terms of trade will improve. However, these exports will become less competitive, and a lower quantity of them will be exported. This is not reflected in the ToT value as it only accounts for average prices.</td>
				<td>In the long run, inflation will drive a large improvement in the terms of trade, as exports become progressively more expensive relative to imports and the ToT will improve considerably. However, this may not necessarily be good for a country's current account balance, as higher export prices could erode total export volume and thereby export revenue. The effect of the inflation on the current account balance depends on the elasticity of demand for exports, which will be discussed in the next questions.</td>

		This question is really poorly worded and gives insufficient data to come to any meaningful conclusion. The extent to which the trade balance will be shifted depends on the relative magnitude of the price elasticity of demand import and export, as well as the absolute quantity of goods imported and exported. Both PED's can be inelastic, but the one that is relatively more inelastic could determine the effect on the trade balance, which is why I say this is a poorly worded question. If only one or the other had an inelastic PED, then it would be obvious what the answer was, but since it is not, this is impossible to tell. Falling average prices (deterioration) could result in lower import and export prices, though import prices would fall slower than exports, or it's possible that export prices and import prices both increase but imports increase faster, or any other combination of these things so long as import prices remain relatively higher than exports. In this case, the import expenditure will decrease, percentwise, slower than the export prices, though both might fall. The graphs drawn only consider the first case of deterioration that was mentioned. 

		Summary - If the fall in import expenditure PR1 to PR2 in figure 2 reduces the import expenditure to such an extent so as to exceed the PR2 in figure 2 after the fall in export revenue, then the trade balance will improve. This depends on the following factors:
		<ul>
			<li>relative price inelasticities of import and export demand</li>
			<li>relative expenditure and revenue from imports and exports</li>
			<li>The degree of deterioration</li>
			<li>The direction of import and export average prices (both rising, both falling, one of each?)</li>
		</ul>  
		And no meaningful conclusion may be determined. The trade balance might worsen, improve, or stay the same.

		A deterioration in the terms of trade for a developing country, one likely with a large dependence on commodities (primary industry goods that are generally non-differentiated) for their export revenues, means that export prices will decrease and import prices will increase, relative to each other. Primary industry based commodities generally have an inelastic demand for exports, and as such, a deterioration will, according to the total revenue test, result in lower export revenues, and thus lower incomes and living standards for those in the developing countries.

		This diagram summarizes the effects of deterioration on export revenue for export goods with inelastic price elasticity of demand. As prices fall, quantities increase, but relatively less percentage wise than prices. As such, the total revenue will decrease. This is, in general, a bad thing.
